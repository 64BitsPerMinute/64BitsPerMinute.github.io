#for 6 months in Sri Lanka

I am extremely grateful to have the opportunity of a lifetime - a chance to tag along with my Fulbright Scholar girlfriend in Sri Lanka. I'm using this time for accelerated self study of topics in various categories that I either didn't have the time to take, or wasn't able to study in depth during my time earning a B.S. in Computer Science at the University of Virginia. 

###Coding
With my previous employment at OpenSource Connections, I learned a lot about using search and big data applications such as Cassandra and Elasticsearch. I also learned a lot about front & back end web development. I feel like I have a good foundation in those areas, but I'd like to branch out to a few more topics, including functional programming and reactive programming, a deeper study of classical algorithms, and graphics related topics (such as GLSL shaders & OpenGL).
