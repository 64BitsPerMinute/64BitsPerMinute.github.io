#for 6 months in Sri Lanka

I am extremely grateful to have the opportunity of a lifetime - a chance to tag along with my Fulbright Scholar girlfriend in Sri Lanka. I'm using this time for accelerated self study of topics in various categories that I either didn't have the time to take, or wasn't able to study in depth during my time earning a B.S. in Computer Science at the University of Virginia. 

###Code
With my previous employment at OpenSource Connections, I learned a lot about using search and big data applications such as Cassandra and Elasticsearch. I also learned a lot about front & back end web development. I feel like I have a good foundation in those areas, but I'd like to branch out to a few more topics, including functional programming and reactive programming, a deeper study of classical algorithms, and graphics (OpenGL / GLSL shaders).

###Compositions
I have only dabbled in composing songs, so I'm working through some music theory with the goal of enhancing the electronic music I create.

###Productions
In a similar vein, I've produced a few electronic songs (and worked for hundreds of hours on electronic mixes over the past 5 years!), but now that I know my tool of choice (Ableton Live) extremely well, I need more practice with arranging and the final mixdown of a songs. I also have a few more long form mixes on the way.

###Visualizations
I took a graphics course with the amazing Jason Lawrence back at UVA, and my most recent concert had real time visuals running in a show tool I designed within TouchDesigner. However, I would like to dig deeper into the OpenGL pipeline, Open GL ES (and the limits of graphics on mobile devices), and GLSL Shaders. I also found a partner in Sri Lanka to work on projection mapping in TouchDesigner with. I also have a side project involving augmented reality and concert visuals to work on.

###Lifestyle
There are many things to do and see in Sri Lanka! At some point in between all this coding and music I'm hoping to get outside for some fresh air. Maybe I'll sleep too. Maybe.
