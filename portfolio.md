the sacred & the profane &#124; precision & chaos &#124; endless love & infinite wrath

A synthesthetic exploration of modernity, MIDNIGHT is a journey through abstract landscapes in search of reality. Along the way, it traces patterns of human belief and the imminent threat of humanity against itself.

MIDNIGHT is an intricately crafted audiovisual work powered by a multinode performance system built for this event in TouchDesigner. This system enables mesmerizing lighting and visuals rendered in real time in sync with a precisely sculpted mix of electronic music that juxtaposes the timeless and contemporary. Features a pixel mapped LED ceiling and  projected visuals, within an immersive room filled with LED lighting.

The Sustainable Fitness project at UVA was awarded funds to create an excercise bicycle that tracked electricity generated and rerouted that power back into the gym's power grid. My teammates built the bike while I created a monitoring app for an attached tablet, wrote the Arduino code for the hall effect sensor, and deployed an online database for application statistics.
