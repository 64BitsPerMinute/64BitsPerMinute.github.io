### Hello World!
For the next 6 months, I'm going to be living in Sri Lanka! This blog will be a record of my adventures, with some rambling thrown in for good measure. My girlfriend, Anna Boynton, was a recipient of a FullBright Scholarship! She will be teaching at the University of Colombo. So I'm going to be tailing along, working on some online college courses, studying certain math and computer science topics, and working on my music composition and production skills.

Fair warning, this post will be pretty long, as there's a lot of things to process in a new environment!

## Day 1 - December 28th, 2015 

![Landing in Sri Lanka]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/hello-world/landing.jpg)

Arrival in Sri Lanka at 5:50am. The weeks before leaving were very busy, so I didn't have much time to be excited. However, arriving near dawn, I was able to identify where along the coast the plane was since I had studied the coastline a bit, and then everything clicked, and I was suddenly reenergized and ready to tackle anything! Anna warned me about the heat and humidity, but that didn't prepare me for the post-rain blast of humidity stepping off the plane. Any sort of vague activity pursued long enough will inevitably lead to sweat and needing a shower. Walking for more than 10 minutes? You're going to need a shower later. That's just how things go here. I had a bit of a frustrating time getting through immigration due to an unhelpful help desk, but an hour later, I had my luggage and walked out to a huge throng of people, with Anna in the front ready to greet me! After that reunion, we took an hour ride in a cab back to the location where Anna had been staying during her language preparation (her actual teaching starts in January). There's so much green growth in Sri Lanka! Outlined against a crisp blue sky and perfect white clouds, it's no surprise it's referred to as the 'wonder of asia'.

The house was nestled off of a side road, and had an amazing assortment of life all around. I took several sound recordings, the sounds were just too fascinating not to capture for later.

I was feeling good enough after a nap to explore a little, so we walked to a Buddhist temple nearby. It was very interesting! I got a crash course on the Buddha's life as we walking through the pictorial history on the walls of the temple. 

## Day 2 - December 29th, 2015

Anna had to move out of the FullBright sponsored house, so in the morning we moved to a nice European style hotel room, where we're going to stay until we can move in to the apartment we've picked out on January 1st. The afternoon consisted of a little exploration of the streets around the hotel, and a lot of napping.

Near sunset, we made our way to a beach on the east coast. It was absolutely gorgeous!

## Day 3 - December 30th, 2015

![Hansa]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/hello-world/hansa.jpg)

I was feeling pretty jet lagged, so we honestly didn't do a whole lot other than a few ineffective attempts at banking, and eating at some interesting shops and restaurants. We also found a great little coffee shop called Hansa Coffee, which has some amazing Iced Thai Coffee, and pretty good download speeds (1 MB/s down).

## Day 4 - December 31st, 2015

![Hansa Blog]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/hello-world/hansablog.jpg)

Today has been a slow day so far, dealing with some more bank issues. I think I'm mostly recovered from jet lag at this point. Surprisingly, it has turned out to be much cheaper/faster/simpler to use a western union transfer than a bank wire. Didn't see that one coming. But now we're cozy in Hansa coffee again, and I've churned through this blog. 

## Observations

#Traffic
The traffic is very interesting. Think of New York City. Very busy, with a lot of traffic, but it's all 'grid-locked'. Very precise cycles of lights with notated lanes makes the traffic feel rigid.

Colombo traffic is a whole different story. It's completely organic. Most areas except for downtown don't have traffic lights, which leads to continuous streams of traffic. The vehicles are a mix of sizes, large buses to mid sized cars (many nissan cars, but also many toyotas, with the occasional prius or bmw), to the many motorcycles, scooters, and tuktuks zipping about. But everybody weaves in where there's enough space to fit, leading to a pulsing, organic movement along the streets. You can see pictures of this type of traffic, but it wouldn't translate the movement and life well. 

On the downside, exhaust regulations must not be nearly as stringent or enforced as the US. Usually it's not too terrible, but occasionally a decrepit truck with a broken muffler will coat the street in a haze. It's not fun.

#Foreigners
Or, to be more precise, the lack of them. Anna tells me this is a product of being in the capital, and not a more 'touristy' destination like the southern beaches, but foreigners are rare. I would estimate I've seen maybe 5-15 each day during full days of walking around the city.

#Food

Food here is primarily curry & rice based, with different types of bread type foods to soak the curries up. But the traditional way of eating rice and curry actually means using your fingers to roll the curry and rice into little balls which you then grab and eat. It's a bit messy, but once you get the feel for it, it's a rather quick and intuitive way of eating. Also, this means a standard feature of food shops both large and small are rather prominently displayed sinks for hand washing. The curries are usually somewhat spicy, but not nearly as hot as I was expecting. Also, since Sri Lanka is primarily Buddhist, followed by Hindu, there are many delicious vegetarian restaurants, and every other restaurant we've been too so far has a large vegetarian menu. Anna and I are both vegetarian, so this is a very welcome surprise.

#Cost of Living

I'll probably make a whole blog post about this once I've had time to explore this more, but it appears like there are two economies. It's not as clear cut as tourist economy vs native economy, but tourists definitely play into the upper spectrum of the system. On the upper end, prices are pretty equivalent to American prices. On the lower, you can start to purchase certain items very cheaply. The primary unit of currency is the Sri Lankan Rupee (which is different than the (Indian) rupee). The exchange rate is roughly $7.00 USD -> 1000 SLR. Food at little side shops will typically run 200-400 rupees ($1.40-$2.80) for a full meal of curry + sides for two people. A tuktuk ride for a few minutes is typically 50 rupees ($.35) as a base fare under .5 km, and then a scaling parameters of a few rupees for 10th of a kilometer. A 1-1.5 taxi ride from the airport to Colombo will run you 1.5k to 3k rupees ($10.50 to $21) depending on how much you're getting ripped off. Western restaurants, hotels, and services start to scale much more quickly. Also, electronics can wildly vary on price, depending on whether they are being imported from Asia or from the US/Europe. One can live cheaply, though it'll be much closer to earth than some travelers may prefer or be prepared for.

## Moving Forward
Later today we're going to see a museum, and later tonight watching the New Year's fireworks on the beach! Tomorrow we'll be moving into our new apartment for the next 6 months. I've been treating these first few days as a complete vacation, but I'm hoping to ramp up my studies slowly next week, and within a week or two start churning through material at full speed. Within the next month, we're hoping to see some of the other FullBrighters in small trips. These would including  visiting the southern beaches past Galle, taking the train through the amazing life and foilage to Kandy (the cultural capital of Sri Lanka), or maybe working our way towards the north of the island to Jaffna. To all my family and friends in the US and elsewhere, stay safe, and have a Happy New Year!
